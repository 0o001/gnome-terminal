  <!-- Reflow. Launch does not need to be in quotes, run is more apropriate
  than either term. Check with Christian if one can actually run a "custom
  command" or whether the UI means just run another shell and is referring only
  to commands that run a shell. -->
  <p>A shell is software that provides an interface for users of an operating system to invoke or "launch" another program; however, shells frequently have additional capabilities such as viewing the contents of directories.</p>

  <p>To start <app>Terminal</app> to run a command or a shell other than <gui>Bash</gui>:</p>
  <!-- Bash is an app more than a GUI. Check if gnome-user-help mentions it and
  if yes, how it is marked up. -->

  <!-- Indent steps only by two spaces as they are on the same "level" as
  paragraphs. -->
    <steps>
      <item>

      </item>
    </steps>

  <note style="important">
    <p>You may have to enter full path to the command or shell in case you have not added the directory where the command or shell resides to the system's PATH variable.</p>
  <!-- Do not use possessive for inanimate objects. the PATH should be marked
  up. -->
