  This is a GNOME documentation template, designed by the GNOME
  Documentation Project Team. Please use it for writing GNOME
  documentation, making obvious changes. In particular, all the words
  written in UPPERCASE (with the exception of GNOME) should be
  replaced. As for "legalnotice", please leave the reference
  unchanged.

  Remember that this is a guide, rather than a perfect model to follow
  slavishly. Make your manual logical and readable.  And don't forget
  to remove these comments in your final documentation!  ;-)

  <title>GNOME Terminal Manual</title>
 <!-- According to GFDL, the Title Page "should use  a title distinct from that of 
      the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were 
      any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same 
      title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives 
      permission." An easy way to satisfy this requirement (if you do
      not have orginal publisher's permission)  is to include version
      number as part of the title, e.g. MY-GNOME-APP V2.0
