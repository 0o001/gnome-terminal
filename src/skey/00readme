<What's Donkey?>

Donkey is an alternative for S/KEY's "key" command. The new feature that
the original key doesn't have is print an entry for skeykeys as
follows;

	kazu 0099 al02004          115d83956f1089b6  Apr 26,1995 22:13:27

This means that donkey is also an alternative for "keyinit". Since the
entry is printed to stdout (not to /etc/skeykeys), you can easily sent
it to remote operator by e-mail (with PGP signature or something). So,
it possible to initiate S/KEY without login from the console of the
host.

The name "Donkey" is an acronym of "Don't Key".


<How to use Donkey>

(1) Calculate an One-Time-Password.

Execute Donkey with sequence and seed, then input your passphrase.

	% donkey 80 is12345
	Enter passphrase : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	SOFT O SAW SWAB CON RODE

You can choose hash function from MD2, MD4, and MD5.

	% donkey 80 is12345
	Enter passphrase : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	SOFT O SAW SWAB CON RODE

	%donkey -f md5 80 is12345
	Enter passphrase : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	LACK WIN ROSE ANNA STUN REEK

The default hash function is MD4 due to the historical reason.


(2) Calculate some One-Time-Passwords at once.

Use -n option.

	% donkey -n 10 80 is12345
	Enter passphrase : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	71: WORE HELL CUB FAR DORA MALE  
	72: SAIL DAN DONE BEER DAYS MOS  
	73: PAN TONE THAT TOUT BURY EST  
	74: KEN ROAM HEAT NAN MEAN HEN   
	75: MINI MARS HASH BOTH SITU SING
	76: TOW SHIN FLUE ARID AHOY NE   
	77: SLID LEEK NO TREE STOW BEY   
	78: RUDY WINE GIFT FUSS AGEE SUE 
	79: GELD THIN MAID THIN BUD TURF 
	80: SOFT O SAW SWAB CON RODE     

Note that though "Enter passphrase" is printed out to stderr,
One-Time-Passwords is to stdout. So, you can redirect the output
safely.

(3) Print skeykeys entry.

Use -i option without argments. Then, enter login name, sequence and
seed. If you like default value, just type RET. Input your passphrase
twice to get the entry.

	% donkey -i
	Enter login name [default kazu]: 
	Enter sequence 1 to 999 [default 99]: 
	Enter new seed [default ur18122]: 
	Please choose passphrase between 8 and 256 characters.
	Enter passphrase : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	Re-enter passphrase : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
