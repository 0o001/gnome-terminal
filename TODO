- wire up the whole configuration-editor dialog, 
  using the glade file for it
- add --use-factory feature using Bonobo
- wire up missing menu items
- actually connect to session manager and send it the computed
  CloneCommand/RestartCommand
- convert option parsing to use a callback since libgnome requires
  that I think
- call gnome_program_init()
- have some way to close tabs
- grep 'FIXME' and fix that stuff
- we need to set the "role" hint for each window, and
  restore it when we restore the window; I believe the role hint 
  should probably be something like all the profiles for tabs
  in the windows, concatenated, so that all windows which are not 
  interchangeable have a different role hint. I think but am not sure
  we are allowed to change the role hint on mapped windows, I hope so.
  On restore, if a profile has disappeared so we fall back to default profile,
  we still need to set the role hint to the command-line-requested profile
  name rather than the default profile name.
- change the new/delete profile menu items to "manage profile"; have a
  dialog that lets you add/delete/edit profiles
- change "specialness" of Default profile, so you can rename/delete it; 
  but require that there's always at least one profile?
  (problem here is that it's much easier to lose settings?)
  If we do this, the "manage profiles" dialog needs something like:
      The default profile is: [profile option menu]
- go through gnome-terminal carefully and be sure all subtleties
  are handled
